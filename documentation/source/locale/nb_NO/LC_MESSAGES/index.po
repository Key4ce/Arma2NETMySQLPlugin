"This program has had a long history.  Initially, the program used "
"`JayArma2Lib`_ because DLL injections were the only way to pass information "
"between Arma2 and the outside.  Eventually, BIS added `CallExtension`_ which"
" allows for a more structured (non-hacky) way to pass information.  "
"JayArma2Lib switched to using CallExtension and things continued. "
"Development of a program that used JayArma2Lib to connect to MySQL was `done"
" here`_ and an `example mission`_ was created."
