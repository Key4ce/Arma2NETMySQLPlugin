msgid "This program has had a long history.  Initially, the program used `JayArma2Lib`_ because DLL injections were the only way to pass information between Arma2 and the outside.  Eventually, BIS added `CallExtension`_ which allows for a more structured (non-hacky) way to pass information.  JayArma2Lib switched to using CallExtension and things continued. Development of a program that used JayArma2Lib to connect to MySQL was `done here`_ and an `example mission`_ was created."
