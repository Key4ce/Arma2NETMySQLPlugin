<p>This program acts as an intermediary between Arma2 and a MySQL database.  It currently only supports MySQL.  It uses the
<a href="https://dev-heaven.net/projects/a2n">Arma2NET</a> wrapper system.  It is written in C#.  The program has to be run on the
same system as your Arma2 server, however, the MySQL database can be either local or remote.</p>

<a name="systemreqs"><h2>Requirements</h2></a>

To run the application:
<ul>
	<li>You need a Windows server. (see known issues)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.mysql.org" target="_blank">A MySQL server and database setup</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/">MySQL Connector for .NET</a> The program has been
	successfully tested with version 6.5.4</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=24872">Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile</a></li>
	<li>Arma2OA Beta version 87640 or later (full client or dedicated server)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>See <a href="https://dev-heaven.net/issues/31028">here</a> for a note about Windows dedicated servers and required files.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>


<a name="howto"><h2>How To Use Arma2NETMySQL</h2></a>

<ul>
	<li>Setup a MySQL database and create some stored procedures to use.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>MySQL stored procedures are essentially just stored commands that run.  If you know basic SQL commands (SELECT, 
			INSERT, UPDATE) you should be fine.  These stored procedures can optionally have parameters that are passed which
			can then be used in the procedure.</li>
			<li>There are all kinds of tutorials on Google regarding MySQL stored procedures but the best one I've found so far with nice
			examples are these: <a href="http://www.mysqltutorial.org/getting-started-with-mysql-stored-procedures.aspx" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> and
			<a href="http://www.mysqltutorial.org/stored-procedures-parameters.aspx" target="_blank">Stored Procedure Parameters</a>.  The related tutorials links
		on the bottom of the page are also in the same series.</li>
			<li>In addition, there's an example SQL file that sets up two databases and some example stored procedures for the example mission.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Edit the Databases.txt file (requires separate lines for each database, even if they're on the same host).</li>
		<ul>
			<li>This database text file stores usernames and passwords in plaintext.  Be very careful about who has access to this!  In addition,
			Arma2NETMySQL does not limit the actions that can be performed on the database.  For security reasons, create a username that is locked down
			and only has access to a single database.  We will not be responsible if something gets deleted!</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Run Arma2 and use this for your command line parameters (for the server which connects to the database):
		<pre>-mod=expansion\beta;expansion\beta\expansion;@CBA;@CBA_A2;@CBA_OA;@Arma2NET -arma2netdev</pre>
		<p>Alternatively, you can not use the -arma2netdev commandline parameter and just edit one of the settings file.
		Open up Settings.yaml and set "DisableSandboxing" to true.  Essentially, the reason why all of this is necessary
		is because only approved "signed" versions of plugins are accepted when the sandbox is active.  This allows third-party
		plugins to be run.</p>
		<p>Arma2 clients do not need to do any of this.  They will interact with the Arma2 server and through SQF scripting, so you can
		pass the information from the database back to them or use it however you need.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Look at the <a href="https://github.com/firefly2442/Arma2NetMySQLPlugin-ExampleMission">example mission</a>
	for how to use the SQF scripting and get data inside the game.</li>
	<li>Use the array of arrays that are returned back.</li>
	<li>Enjoy.</li>
</ul>

<a name="known_issues"><h2>Known Issues</h2></a>

<p>Arma2NETMySQL Plugin uses the callExtension function, however, there are some
<a href="http://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Extensions#A_few_technical_considerations">technical considerations</a> as part of this.
</p>

<a name="troubleshooting"><h2>Troubleshooting</h2></a>

<p>Stuck?  First check the "logs" folder.  The plugin creates a new log file each time it's run.  Go into your root Arma2 folder where
the executable is, then find the "logs" folder.  If there are errors or things, they will show up there.  If you don't have
a logs folder or it's empty, this is a sign the plugin isn't running.  Try the second step:</p>
<p>Arma2NET also stores log files which are located here: <pre>C:\Users\Yourname\AppData\Local\Arma2NET</pre>
This will tell you if the plugin is loading appropriately.  If it's not, check your launcher and make sure that is all correct.</p>
<p>You can also check the RPT files generated by Arma 2.  These are located here: <pre>C:\Users\Yourname\AppData\Local\ArmA 2 OA</pre>
These can get very long so scroll all the way to the bottom to see the latest run.  This will tell you if you have an error in
your SQF scripting code or other such problems.  Note, these path locations are for Windows 7 (and Vista?) and may be different
for other versions of Windows.</p>

<p>If you're still stuck or you found a bug, please create an issue ticket here:
<a href="https://github.com/firefly2442/Arma2NETMySQLPlugin">Github page</a>.</p>
<p>There is also discussion on the <a href="http://forums.bistudio.com">BIS forums</a> so that's another
place to go for help.  The forums are preferred over emailing me because then the question/answer is available to
future people who have similar problems.</p>
