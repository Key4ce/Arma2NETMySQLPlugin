<p>This program acts as an intermediary between Arma2/Arma3 and a MySQL or SQLite database.  It uses the
<a href="https://dev-heaven.net/projects/a2n">Arma2NET</a> wrapper system.  It is written in C#.  The program has to be run on the
same system as your Arma2/Arma3 server, however, the MySQL database can be either local or remote.  The SQLite database runs on the 
local machine.  Please read this entire document as it has many important details regarding the installation and setup.</p>

<p>History:</p>
<p>This program has had a long history.  Initially, the program used JayArma2Lib because DLL injections were the only way to
pass information between Arma2 and the outside.  Eventually, BIS added <a href="http://community.bistudio.com/wiki/callExtension">callExtension</a>
which allowed for a more structured (non-hacky) way to pass information.  JayArma2Lib switched to this and things continued.  Development
was done <a href="http://dev-heaven.net/projects/arma2-mysql">here</a> and an example mission was
<a href="http://dev-heaven.net/projects/arma2mysql-example">here</a>.  Technically, all that code should still work but the bad
part was all the formatting and ugly stuff that had to be done in game via the SQF scripting in order to get the data into a reasonable
format.  It involved iterating through strings and creating arrays and generally was still pretty hacky.  Then,
<a href="https://dev-heaven.net/projects/a2n">Arma2NET</a> came along and things got better.  This wrapper system allowed us to
return nice results back to Arma2 and not have to deal with all the formatting nonsense.  I ended up just copying the bits and pieces
that were needed from the past project and creating a new application.  Development is all done via the Github pages.  In addition,
the <a href="http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?111484-ArmA2-Persistent-Database-Scripts-WIP">Persistent Database Scripts</a>
system as created by <a href="http://forums.bistudio.com/member.php?30502-KH-Jman">[KH]JMan</a> currently uses builds of this program
for saving data.  In addition, <a href="https://dev-heaven.net/projects/mso/wiki">MSO</a>, a modular mission framework uses
it for saving information.

<a name="systemreqs"><h2>Requirements</h2></a>

To run the plugin:
<ul>
	<li>You need a Windows server. (<a href="#known_issues">see known issues</a>)</li>
	<li>One of the following:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.mysql.org" target="_blank">A MySQL server and database setup</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.sqlite.org" target="_blank">A SQLite database setup</a></li>
	</ul>
	<li>Install the following dependencies based on whether you are using MySQL or SQLite:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Note that if you are using a precompiled version of this plugin, you may need to use the specific version of the connectors listed
		below.  There have been reports of the plugin not working with newer versions of these database connectors.  I will attempt to keep things
		relatively up-to-date.  Alternatively, you can compile the plugin yourself if you have Visual Studio.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/">MySQL Connector for .NET</a> The plugin has been
		successfully tested with version 6.7.4 (mysql-connector-net-6.7.4.msi)</li>
		<li><a href="http://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/downloads.wiki">Precompiled Binaries of SQLite
		for 32-bit Windows (.NET Framework 4.0)</a> The plugin has been successfully tested with version 1.0.88.0 (sqlite-netFx40-setup-bundle-x86-2010-1.0.89.0.exe)</li>
	</ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=24872">Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile</a></li>
	<li>Arma 2 or Arma 3</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Arma2OA Beta version 87640 or later (full client or dedicated server)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>See <a href="https://dev-heaven.net/issues/31028">here</a> for a note about Windows dedicated servers and required files.</li>
				<li>I would recommend running whatever <a href="http://www.arma2.com/beta-patch.php" target="_blank">Beta version</a> is
				the latest, while it may not be super stable, it should have the latest features.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Arma 3 (all versions supported)</li>
	</ul>
	<li><a href="https://dev-heaven.net/projects/a2n" target="_blank">Arma2NET</a>, this should already be included if you downloaded a compiled
	version of this plugin.</li>
</ul>


<a name="howto"><h2>How To Use Arma2NETMySQL</h2></a>

<p>Arma2NETMySQL looks two places for the relevant files and folders.  First, it checks the Arma2/Arma3 root directory.  If it can't find
them there, it looks in the AppData folder.  I would recommend using the AppData location if possible.  This makes future upgrades
and changes easier to manage.  However, some people on limited rental servers may need to put them in the root Arma2/Arma3 folder.
Make sure the file/folder structure matches one of these.  Don't put some files in one location and some in the other,
that could result in problems.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<pre>This is just an example location for Arma 2, you'll have to figure out where your Arma game folder is.</pre>
		<pre>E:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\arma 2 operation arrowhead\</pre>
		<pre>E:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\arma 2 operation arrowhead\Databases.txt</pre>
		<pre>E:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\arma 2 operation arrowhead\sqlite\</pre>
		<pre>E:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\arma 2 operation arrowhead\logs\</pre>
	</li>
	<li>OR...</li>
	<li>
		<pre>C:\Users\Yourname\AppData\Local\Arma2NETMySQL\</pre>
		<pre>C:\Users\Yourname\AppData\Local\Arma2NETMySQL\Databases.txt</pre>
		<pre>C:\Users\Yourname\AppData\Local\Arma2NETMySQL\sqlite\</pre>
		<pre>C:\Users\Yourname\AppData\Local\Arma2NETMySQL\logs\</pre>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>This location is for Windows 7/Vista, if you're running an older version, this location will probably be different.</p>

<p>The folder structure for Arma2NET should look like the following.  Note that if you downloaded a compiled version of the plugin,
this should already be included and already setup correctly.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<pre>This is just an example location for Arma 2, you'll have to figure out where your Arma game folder is.</pre>
		<pre>E:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\arma 2 operation arrowhead\@Arma2NET\</pre>
		<pre>E:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\arma 2 operation arrowhead\@Arma2NET\Addins\</pre>
		<pre>E:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\arma 2 operation arrowhead\@Arma2NET\AddIns\Arma2NETMySQLPlugin\</pre>
		<pre>E:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\arma 2 operation arrowhead\@Arma2NET\AddIns\Arma2NETMySQLPlugin\Arma2NETMySQLPlugin.dll</pre>
		<pre>E:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\arma 2 operation arrowhead\@Arma2NET\AddIns\Arma2NETMySQLPlugin\MySql.Data.dll</pre>
		<pre>E:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\arma 2 operation arrowhead\@Arma2NET\AddIns\Arma2NETMySQLPlugin\System.Data.SQLite.dll</pre>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Edit the Databases.txt file (requires separate lines for each database, even if they're on the same host).</li>
		<ul>
			<li>This database text file stores usernames and passwords in plaintext.  Be very careful about who has access to this!  In addition,
			Arma2NETMySQL does not limit the actions that can be performed on the database.  For security reasons, create a username that is locked down
			and only has access to a single database.  We do not recommend connecting to the database as the root user.
			This is generally a really bad choice because this user has full access.
			We will not be responsible if something gets deleted!  Please note that there
			are no checks for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a> attacks so be extremely
			careful about how you allow users to input information that will run against the database.</li>
			<li>Put the Databases.txt file in the appropriate location (see above notes).</li>
		</ul>
	<li>There are two ways to run MySQL queries with this plugin.  One is using MySQL stored procedures and the other
	is just to use straight queries.</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Stored Procedures:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Setup a MySQL database and create some stored procedures to use.  For information regarding permissions required
				to create and execute stored procedures, see this <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/stored-routines-privileges.html">MySQL guide</a>.</li>
				<li>MySQL stored procedures are essentially just stored commands that run.  If you know basic SQL commands (SELECT, 
				INSERT, UPDATE) you should be fine.  These stored procedures can optionally have parameters that are passed which
				can then be used in the procedure.</li>
				<li>There are all kinds of tutorials on Google regarding MySQL stored procedures but the best one I've found so far with nice
				examples are these: <a href="http://www.mysqltutorial.org/getting-started-with-mysql-stored-procedures.aspx" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> and
				<a href="http://www.mysqltutorial.org/stored-procedures-parameters.aspx" target="_blank">Stored Procedure Parameters</a>.  The related tutorials links
				on the bottom of the page are also in the same series.</li>
				<li>Your SQF code will look something like this:
				<pre>_strCreate = format ["[u=%1,n=%2,a=%3,b=%4,c=%5,d=%6,e=%7]", _allWeapons select 0, _loadoutName, _allWeapons select 1,
								_allWeapons select 2, _allWeapons select 3, 
								_allWeapons select 4, _allWeapons select 5];</pre>
				<pre>_create = "Arma2Net.Unmanaged" callExtension format ["Arma2NETMySQL ['weapons', 'CreateNewLoadOut', '%1']", _strCreate];</pre>
				In this example, "weapons" is the database name.  "CreateNewLoadOut" is the MySQL stored procedure.  And all the parameters
				as part of the procedure are formatted appropriately and then passed along as the third argument.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Straight queries:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>This is similar to what you're probably used to.  Commands like:
				<pre>SELECT * FROM table WHERE name = 'user'</pre></li>
				<li>There are two ways to run straight SQL queries.  The first way is a little simpler and easier on the SQF scripting side.
				It uses the command Arma2NETMySQLCommand and will block until a result is returned.
				The other way is to use the command Arma2NETMySQLCommandAsync which is better for servers that will heavily
				utilize this plugin and have significant numbers of players.  This will return null immediately upon calling it because
				it's an asynchronous call.  You will then need to loop and continue calling it until you get the result back.  If you
				are fairly proficient with SQF, I would recommend the second option.
				<ul>
					<li>
					<p>Option One: Arma2NETMySQLCommand:</p>
					<p>Your SQF code will look something like this:</p>
					<pre>_selectTest = "Arma2Net.Unmanaged" callExtension "Arma2NETMySQLCommand ['weapons', 'SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 3']";</pre>
					<p>In this example, "weapons" is the database name.  The next portion is the entire MySQL command which you will need
					to create manually.  This will block until the database call is complete and the result is returned.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
					<p>Option Two: Arma2NETMySQLCommandAsync</p>
					<p>Your SQF will look something like this:</p>
					<pre>
_selectTest = nil;
while {isNil("_selectTest")} do {
	_selectTest = "Arma2Net.Unmanaged" callExtension "Arma2NETMySQLCommandAsync ['weapons', 'SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 3']";
	if (_selectTest == "") then {
		_selectTest = nil;
	};
	sleep 0.5;  //sleep for a half-second so we don't thrash the server with callExtension calls
};
					</pre>
					<p>In this example, "weapons" is the database name.  The next portion is the entire MySQL command which you will need
					to create manually.  You will then need to loop until the result is returned.</p>
				</ul>
			</ul>
	</ol>
	<li>There is one way to run SQLite queries with this plugin.</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Setup database:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Databases need to be in your root Arma2 folder or the appdata sqlite folder (see above notes).</li>
				<li>And they need to have the following filename ending:</li>
				<pre>.sqlite</pre>
				<li>So, for example you might have:</li>
				<pre>C:\Users\Yourname\AppData\Local\Arma2NETMySQL\sqlite\weapons.sqlite</pre>
				<li>Make sure your database name matches the name in the Databases.txt file (minus the .sqlite ending of course).</li>
				<li>If you need a client for creating and managing SQLite databases, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">
				this Firefox plugin</a> is quite nice.</li>
			</ul>
<li>Straight queries:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>This is similar to what you're probably used to.  Commands like:
				<pre>SELECT * FROM table WHERE name = 'user'</pre></li>
				<li>There are two ways to run straight SQL queries.  The first way is a little simpler and easier on the SQF scripting side.
				It uses the command Arma2NETMySQLCommand and will block until a result is returned.
				The other way is to use the command Arma2NETMySQLCommandAsync which is better for servers that will heavily
				utilize this plugin and have significant numbers of players.  This will return null immediately upon calling it because
				it's an asynchronous call.  You will then need to loop and continue calling it until you get the result back.  If you
				are fairly proficient with SQF, I would recommend the second option.
				<ul>
					<li>
					<p>Option One: Arma2NETMySQLCommand:</p>
					<p>Your SQF code will look something like this:</p>
					<pre>_selectTest = "Arma2Net.Unmanaged" callExtension "Arma2NETMySQLCommand ['weapons', 'SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 3']";</pre>
					<p>In this example, "weapons" is the database name.  The next portion is the entire MySQL command which you will need

					<pre>
_selectTest = nil;
while {isNil("_selectTest")} do {
	_selectTest = "Arma2Net.Unmanaged" callExtension "Arma2NETMySQLCommandAsync ['weapons', 'SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 3']";
	if (_selectTest == "") then {
		_selectTest = nil;
	};
	sleep 0.5;  //sleep for a half-second so we don't thrash the server with callExtension calls
};
					</pre>
					<p>In this example, "weapons" is the database name.  The next portion is the entire MySQL command which you will need
					to create manually.  You will then need to loop until the result is returned.</p>
				</ul>
			</ul>
	</ol>
	<li>Run Arma2/Arma3 and add @Arma2NET as a mod.  For example your command line parameters (for the server which connects to the database):
		<pre>-mod=expansion\beta;expansion\beta\expansion;@Arma2NET</pre>
		<p>This plugin doesn't require any other third party mods like ACE or CBA.  But, they do have some nice utility functions
		and features that may be helpful when you make your missions.</p>
		<p>Arma2/Arma3 player clients do not need to do any of this.  They will interact with the Arma2/Arma3 server and through SQF scripting, so you can
		pass the information from the database back to them or use it however you need.</p>
	</li>
	<li>For Arma 2:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Look at the <a href="https://github.com/firefly2442/Arma2NetMySQLPlugin-ExampleMission">Arma 2 example mission</a>
			for how to use the SQF scripting and get data inside the game.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>For Arma 3:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Look at the <a href="https://github.com/firefly2442/Arma2NetMySQLPlugin-Arma3-ExampleMission">Arma 3 example mission</a>
			for how to use the SQF scripting and get data inside the game.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Use the array of arrays that are returned back.</li>
	<li>Enjoy.</li>
</ul>

<a name="known_issues"><h2>Known Issues</h2></a>

<p>Arma2NETMySQL Plugin uses the callExtension function, however, there are some
<a href="http://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Extensions#A_few_technical_considerations">technical considerations</a> as part of this.
</p>
<p>Returning results in Arma 2 beta 97299 or greater has a limit of 16383 (~16 KB) characters.  If you try to run a query that will return a result longer than 16383 characters,
it will return the string "TooLong".  Then you know you will need to limit the number of results that are returned.  In MySQL,
you can use <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/select.html">the limit parameter</a>, or in SQLite,
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_select.html">the limit parameter</a>.  This is a limitation of
Arma2 so don't ask for this to be fixed.</p>
<p>The length limit for Arma 3 appears to be similar, however, this may change in the future.</p>
<p>Currently, commas cannot be used as data to be sent back and forth because the system uses commas to identify
splitting up the database columns.  If you have a suggestion for how to solve this or would like to submit a fix, I would
certainly appreciate it.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://community.bistudio.com/wiki/callExtension">callExtension</a> method will block on the server until
a result is returned.  Some people were reporting problems when running this plugin on servers with lots of players and running
many database calls.  This was lagging the server and causing players issues.  If you are doing this and using Arma2NETMySQLCommand
and need super high performance, consider switching over to the asynchronous
method of using Arma2NETMySQLCommandAsync.</p>

<a name="troubleshooting"><h2>Troubleshooting</h2></a>

<p>Windows 7 (and other Windows versions?) can sometimes block DLLs from running. If you right click the .dll and click on properties
at the bottom of the list there is a security tab. For the precompiled DLL, it knows the DLL came from another computer and
thus doesn't trust it.  You'll need to enable the DLL to run.  If you are not comfortable with this, you can always compile
the source code and generate the DLL yourself.</p>
<p>For the dependency DLL files of MySQL and SQLite, if you are having trouble and it is giving you an error about System.IO.FileNotFoundException
there is a possible solution.  You can try putting the DLL dependencies for these two in @Arma2NET/DLLhere.dll.  Just copy the DLL files
from the installed location to this root @Arma2NET folder.  You will need to relaunch the game.</p>
<p>If you are getting a returned result of "Error" in the game, this means there's something wrong with your query.  Check
the logs to track down the problem.</p>
<p>Stuck?  First check the "logs" folder.  The plugin creates a new log file each time it's run.  Go into your appdata folder
or the root Arma game folder and then find the "logs" folder.  If there are errors or things, they will show up there.
<pre>C:\Users\Yourname\AppData\Local\Arma2NETMySQL\logs\</pre>
If you don't have a logs folder or it's empty, this is a sign the plugin isn't running.  Try the second step:</p>
<p>Arma2NET also stores log files which are located here: <pre>C:\Users\Yourname\AppData\Local\Arma2NET\</pre>
This will tell you if the plugin is loading appropriately.  If it's not, check your launcher and make sure that is all correct.</p>
<p>You can also check the RPT files generated by Arma 2/Arma 3.  These are located here: <pre>C:\Users\Yourname\AppData\Local\{ArmA 2 OA\Arma 3}</pre>
These can get very long so scroll all the way to the bottom to see the latest run.  This will tell you if you have an error in
your SQF scripting code or other such problems.  Note, these path locations are for Windows 7 (and Vista?) and may be different
for other versions of Windows.</p>
<p>If you're still having problems, please go back and double check that you did everything correctly.  If you skipped a step
or got an error and just decided to continue to the next step, nothing will work.</p>

<a name="developers"><h2>For Developers</h2></a>

<p>To examine the sourcecode, open up the provided Visual Studio project.  To compile the code into a .DLL check to make sure
the references are pointing to the correct place.  MySql.Data needs to be listed in the references and should point to "MySql.Data.dll"
which is provided by the MySQL Connector listed above.  System.Data.SQLite should point to "System.Data.SQLite.dll" which is provided
by the SQLite precompiled binaries listed above.  Once these are set, you can compile the sourcecode.  The resulting .DLL should be placed
in the Arma2NET Addins folder here: @Arma2NET\AddIns\Arma2NETMySQLPlugin.  Each plugin is stored in a folder with the name of the DLL.
Any dependency DLLs can also be placed in this folder as well.</p>

<p>For easy testing, you can use Arma2NetExplorer.exe provided by Arma2NET.  After launching this program, click "list addins" to see
if Arma2NETMySQL loaded in correctly.  Then you can run straight commands as outlined in the above documentation.  For example:</p>

<pre>Arma2NETMySQLCommand ['weapons', 'SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 3']</pre>

<p>If the Databases.txt file and your database is setup correctly, you can run straight commands here and see the result.  This is
extremely helpful for testing without having to load up the entire game.  Make sure if you make a change to the C# code that you recompile and copy
over the .DLL to the appropriate folder, otherwise you'll be running the old version and won't see any changes.</p>
